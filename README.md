Purpose: Use backtracking to determine all safe and valid paths to an exit in an arbitrary ASCII maze that is potentially riddled 
with a virus. This program requires you to modify the maze backtracking code presented in class, and so it will also give you 
some experience reading, comprehending, and modifying a fairly sophisticated piece of code that someone else has written.
