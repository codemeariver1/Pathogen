Purpose: Use backtracking to determine all safe and valid paths to an exit in an arbitrary ASCII maze that is potentially riddled 
with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). This program requires you to modify the maze backtracking code presented in 
class, and so it will also give you some experience reading, comprehending, and modifying a fairly sophisticated piece of code 
that someone else has written.
